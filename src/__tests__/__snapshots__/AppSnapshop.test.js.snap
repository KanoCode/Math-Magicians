      A calculator is an app that provides arithmetic capabilities. The most basic calculators, which can cost pennies to purchase, add, subtract, multiply and divide. More advanced devices handle sines, cosines and other trigonometric functions. Whether mechanical or electronic, all calculators accept numeric input from dials, levers or a keypad. The results are displayed as mechanical digits, on punched paper tape or on a screen, such as an LCD. Unlike computers, calculators perform a finite set of functions, and they cannot handle text.
